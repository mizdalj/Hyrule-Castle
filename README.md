# What is this

This is my very first project, a rpg game in the Zelda universe. It is playable through the terminal, you can choose difficulty and the length on the dungeon you want to play. Ennemies are randomly selected from a list as well as bosses every 10 levels.

# How to run the game

First you need to unlock the script using the chmod command: chmod ugo+rx hyrule_castle.sh
Then run the script using this command :./hyrule_castle.sh

# Note

This project was made in collaboration with 2 schoolmates.
